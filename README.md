This is a project that has been created by Josua Kaden, Moritz Zitzow, and Matteo D'Urso for the intersession C-programming course.

The project is a Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer. That means it should include as a minimum functionalities like:
- graphing out a GUI, that is either on a Terminal or using a real GUI with a window, with
  - algorithm selection (BFS, DFS, Dijkstras, A*...)
  - drawing a obstacles
  - including a start- and endpoint
  - some sort of visualization of the path that the algorithm found. Either interactive or only end result. This includes showing all nodes that have been visited throughout the path finding process.

The Algorithms themselves have yet to be implemented. The algorithms are, but not limited to:
- BFS
- DFS
- Dijkstras
- A*
- Some kind of additiional features (fairly hard):
  - restrictions such as "weighted nodes" or only n consecutive steps in the same direction.
